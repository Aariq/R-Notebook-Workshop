# What is an R Notebook?
 
 - A file format (.rmd) that can be opened by R Studio
 - Allow you to mix prose, code, and code output
 - Uses a simple system called Markdown for formatting prose
 - Markdown headings allow easy navigation in R Studio
 - Notebooks can be "knit" to produce beautiful reports as html, pdf, or Word documents
 - Allows configuration of what to show in these outputs (e.g. code, output, warnings)

# Why Notebooks?

 - It's a good practice to annotate your code anyway, and .rmd lets you do this in a richer way
 - As an analysis notebook.  Organizing your code into "chunks" interspersed with prose helps you think through problems better and keep track of your thought process.
 - Portability/collaboration. No need to use `setwd()`
 - Beautiful, easy to navigate reports. You can hide or show code depending on who the report is for (e.g. does this person know R?)
 - Creating examples, tutorials, assignments, etc. using R
 
# Workshop Outline

## Make a Notebook!
Make a new notebook, run the chunks, preview the output

    
## Basics of Markdown

- YAML header (author, subtitle, date)
- headings (and their integration with R studio)
- bold, itallics, subscript, superscript
- lists
- equations
- links and images
- when you can't do something in Markdown (use html/LaTeX)
- where to get more help

## Code chunks
- inserting
- naming (and integration with R studio)
- running (arrow, keyboard shortcut, run all chunks above, run button)
- "self-containedness" (e.g. can't run base R plot stuff that takes two lines without running entire chunk, `setwd()` only effects one chunk)
- in-line code. e.g.  `r rnorm(1)`
- options (in gear menu, and where to find other options)

### Using code chunks for non-code-like output
- `kable()` tables
- `include_graphics()`---similar to using markdown syntax, but allows use of code chunk options

## Reports
- PDF (requires LaTeX)
- Word (not as pretty, but easily editable)
- html (.nb.html files are great to share! Only subtle difference with .html output.)

## Advanced options for reports
- How to add  and code chunk (e.g. `opts_chunk$set <- ...`)
