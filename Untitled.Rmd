# Main heading
## subheading

### sub-subheading

List Header:

- hello
- hello again
- are you there?
- superscripts^3^
- subscripts~easy~

Note: for lists to show up correctly in reports, you must have a blank line between your list header (or any previous text) and the first bullet point of your list.  You must also have a space between the "-" and the list item.  For example, this won't look right:
- no preceding empty line
- effects the entire list, not just the first item

-no space after the hyphen and it won't format right

- this one looks right

$n=5$ n = 5
before $\sqrt\frac{5}{(n-x^{2})}$ I can put text after
$$\sqrt\frac{5}{(n-x^{2})}$$
